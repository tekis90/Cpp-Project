üîç License Plate Prediction and Confidence Evaluation: Reversible Prediction System (C++)
In this project, a reversible prediction mechanism (undo system) has been developed to evaluate and manage the predictions made by an artificial intelligence (AI) model used in license plate recognition systems.
The code simulates the last-in-first-out (LIFO) processing of plate predictions using the stack data structure in the C++ programming language.

üéØ Objective
Predictions made by the AI model may not always have a high confidence rate. This system allows the following:

Each prediction from the AI is added sequentially to a stack.

Predictions with a confidence rate lower than 50% are withdrawn (pop operation).

Predictions with a high confidence rate are accepted and processed.
